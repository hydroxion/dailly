## Installation

Use the package manager [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) to install the dependencies.

```bash
yarn
```

Use the IDE [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) to create a virtual device or [Expo Go](https://expo.io/client), to run the application while in development.

> Notice that some APIs are only available in real devices, i.e through binary installation, Expo Go or USB connection

## Usage

Start the application server.

```sh
yarn start
```

Open [localhost:19002](http://localhost:19002/) where a QR code can be scanned using Expo Go or launch the application in a virtual or real device, by pressing `a` in the CLI.

> Optionally you start the application server to run directly in a device using `yarn android`
