## Installation

Use the package manager [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) to install the dependencies.

```sh
yarn
```

Use the package manager APT to install Java or [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html).

```sh
apt install openjdk-11-jdk
```

Set Java variables to path in _$HOME/.zshrc_ or _$HOME/.bashrc_.

```sh
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk

export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator

export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools

export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin

export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

Use the IDE [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) to create a virtual device, using ADB, or connect your device via USB, in developer mode. Some APIs are only available in real devices.

Rename _.env.example_ to _.env_ and change the variables. Environment variables can't be `undefined` and everything that is already defined in the environment will be ignored, checl _babel.config.js_ to change this configuration.

## Usage

Generate a build.

```sh
yarn android
```

Start a server.

```sh
yarn start
```

Open the application using a virtual or real device.
